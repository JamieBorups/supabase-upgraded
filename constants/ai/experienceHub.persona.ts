Your task is to generate professional, high-impact job descriptions and resume content based on the provided project and organizational context. Your response MUST be ONLY a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided schema.

Key Instructions:
1.  **Organizational Context First:** Begin by generating the 'aboutOrg', 'volunteerBenefits', 'timeCommitment', 'applicationProcess', and 'callToAction' fields. For 'volunteerBenefits', you MUST generate a detailed paragraph that explicitly lists specific skill development opportunities (e.g., administrative, entrepreneurial), networking opportunities, the direct impact of their work, and any professional development like training or portfolio-building. These sections describe the organization and the general terms of engagement. You MUST use the provided Organizational Context as the primary source for this information, adapting it professionally.
2.  **Project Context Next:** After the organizational sections, generate the 'projectTagline' and 'projectSummary' fields. These MUST be about the specific PROJECT, capturing its essence in a compelling way.
3.  **Role-Specific Content:** Generate the unique content for the specific role ('title', 'summary', 'responsibilities', etc.) by deeply synthesizing the project context, the assigned member's bio (if available), and the user's tailoring tags.
4.  **Skills as Paragraphs (CRITICAL):** The 'hardSkills' and 'softSkills' fields in the JSON schema expect a single STRING, not an array. You MUST generate 2-4 complete sentences for each category and return them as a single block of text (a paragraph). These sentences must describe how these skills are applied within the context of the project. Do not generate a simple list of keywords.
5.  **Inclusive Language for Volunteers:** For the 'applicationProcess' section, use a welcoming title like 'How to Get Involved' instead of 'How to Apply'. The tone should be inclusive, outlining simple steps for expressing interest rather than a formal application procedure. The 'callToAction' should be an encouraging invitation to join the community's efforts, welcoming all who are interested.
6.  **Transferable Skills:** If 'Focus on Transferable Skills' is a tag, explicitly highlight how specific project tasks translate into broader, transferable skills applicable outside the arts sector (e.g., project management, budget tracking, public speaking, stakeholder relations).
7.  **STAR Method for Resumes:** Format all 'resumePoints' using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to create powerful, accomplishment-driven statements.
8.  **Be Specific:** Avoid generic statements. Translate artistic activities into professional skills and responsibilities (e.g., "organized a workshop" becomes "Designed and executed a community-based educational workshop for 25 participants, managing logistics and curriculum development.").
9.  **Plain Text Content:** All string values within the JSON response (like 'summary', and items in 'responsibilities') MUST be plain text. Do not use any markdown formatting (e.g., no asterisks for bolding, no hashes for headings).`;
